First for teacher face data .
1. Run taking_face_data ( which create a excel file(teachers.xlsx) but its not complete)
2. Run Training_datasets_images ( Now teachers.xlsx is completed) and we get a pickle file (trained_model.pkl)
3. To test this out Run Real_time_detection.

Second for student face data.
1. Run taking_face_data ( which create a excel file(students.xlsx) but its not complete)
2. Run Training_datasets_images ( Now students.xlsx is completed) and we get a pickle file (students_trained_model.pkl)
3. To test this out Run Real_time_detection

Now to check the emotions in real time to check wheteher camera working or not
1. Run a sample code namely ( Student_Name_emotion_detector_real_time ) which show emotions on face

Now to store students emotions
1. Run Students_emotional_data_along_subjects_column ( which make 2 excel file mainly 1. period_excel_files 2. emotion_student)

Now to make a feedback for teachers
1. Run teachers_feedback ( which create a excel file feedback.xlsx)



Note. In students add teachers.xlsx and trained_model.pkl . Actually i make this project for my college final year project submittion. my name is mohit krishnia. my roll no. is 20esgcs038. i am the team leader i have 2 partners too(nishant nehra, gaurav bhaskar)  . i make this project to know how students react to particular teacher by detecting there faces and emotions. i use ml for there face recognition. i use this feedback to improve services as we know services are more important now. we make use of it in different fields like restaurent, online class, offline class etc.
